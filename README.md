# Distributed Denial of Service Amplification Attacks

Over time I have collected some interesting types of attacks and broke them down to
explain how to either block, or mitigate them.

# What is an "amplification attack"?
Amplification attacks are used in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In particular, these types of "amplified" attacks either
consist of well-formed packets, or malformed packets. Ranging from many different protocols and types, these attacks are hard to mitigate.
Especially in size, amplification attacks are a growing threat to our digital world.

# Why list them on GitHub?
This repository is designed and intended to solely educate and to aid companies of all sizes in protecting their infrastructures.

# How do I compile these scripts?
You can do that using gcc. Not sure how to do that? Have a look below:

gcc example.c -o example -pthread
